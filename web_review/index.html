a review of the web...where do I begin...as a kid being born in the center of a generation whose focus is technology its hard to think of a life before. when you hear of the actual time frame the phone was invented or when the first model of a computer was produced you realize it hasnt been thousands of years like it seems. I think in this world it is inevitable to evolve in all aspects, we are curious humans with thinking brains, however as most things in life I think restrictions should of been made before we were given free range and started putting things out there to the level of no return. I believe that as humans we should try and have souls and not always think about what can be turned in to profit. Selling peoples information or creating robots of us through private CIA operative files or something is not right, yes i know im going down the conspiracy hole but... I believe we have let technology/the internet take away basic skill and knowledge that people envy but are too lazy to change. I think the internet is very resourceful and useful when used appropriately. I give the internet a 5/10 because for as good and useful as it is, it is also dark twisted and cinacal. 
good day mates
