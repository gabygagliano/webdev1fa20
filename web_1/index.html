    <h1>Rocky Mountain National Park</h1>
    <h2>Rocky Mountain National Park in northern Colorado spans the Continental Divide and encompasses protected mountains, forests and alpine tundra. It's known for the Trail Ridge Road and the Old Fall River Road, drives that pass aspen trees and rivers. The Keyhole Route, a climb crossing vertical rock faces, leads up Longs Peak, the parkâ€™s tallest mountain. A trail surrounding Bear Lake offers views of the peaks. </h1>
